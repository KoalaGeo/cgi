CGI's mission is to foster the interoperability and exchange of geoscience information, by active community leadership, collaboration, education, and the development and promotion of geoscience information standards and best practice.

Explore our website for resources about data sharing, [standards](/misc/standards.html), and best practice in geoscience information management.

If you have any feedback, comments, or suggestions, please send them to us via our [Contact Us](/contact.html) page.

## Current Working Groups

[GeoSciML](/tech_collaboration/geosciml.html) — a collaborative OGC-CGI standards working group developing a geological data transfer standard — <label>[Join](mailto:eric.boisvert2@canada.ca?subject=Application to join the GeoSciML Standards Working Group)</label>

[EarthResourceML](/tech_collaboration/earthResourceML.html) — developing a data transfer standard for mineral resources and mining information — <label>[Join](mailto:Jouni.Vuollo@gtk.fi?subject=Application to join the EarthResourceML Working Group)</label>

[Geoscience Terminology](/tech_collaboration/geoscience_terminology_working_group.html) — developing multilingual vocabularies for geoscience and earth resources information — <label>[Join](mailto:chair.gtwg@gmail.com?subject=Application to join the Geoscience Terminology Working Group)</label>

[CGI/OGC Geoscience Domain Working Group](/tech_collaboration/geosciencedwg.html) — aims to connect people to develop, improve and promote technologies for geoscience data description and sharing in OGC. The group is hosted by the OGC and co-chaired with CGI.

### 36th International Geological Congress

#### 2–8 March, 2020, Delhi, India

Abstracts are invited to the special symposium [Advances in geoscience data sharing and processing](https://www.36igc.org/science-program) (Theme 45.10) at the 36th International Geological Congress (IGC). The symposium will highlight new techniques, standards, and algorithms for managing, delivering, visualising and analysing geoscience data both globally and regionally, including 'big' data. The symposium is jointly organised by CGI, IAMG, and OneGeology.

### CGI Award for Young Earth Scientists at the 36th IGC

CGI sponsors an award to assist early career scientists to present at conferences such as the IGC on the use of CGI standards in data delivery and analysis. The award covers up to US$2000 towards the cost of travel and accommodation at the IGC in Delhi. Registration cost is covered by the Young Earth Scientists (YES) Network. [Full details](/docs/CGI_YES_award_2019-20.pdf).

Applications for the 36th IGC award close on 15 October 2019\.


### New EarthResourceML-Lite v2.0.1 data model and schemas released

[EarthResourceML-Lite](http://earthresourceml.org/) is a data model and schema for simple map services (e.g. WMS and WFS Simple Features). It is an abridged version of the full EarthResourceML model and can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.

### Recent CGI Meetings

[ERML meeting, Madrid](/images/ERML-meeting-Madrid.jpg)

Members of the EarthResourceML Working group met at IGME (the Spanish Geological Survey) in Madrid in May. L-R: Wang Yongzhi, Jouni Vuollo (chair), Mark Rattenbury, Ollie Raymond, Katarzyna Sadlowska, and Zhang Minghua.</label>

The CGI Council and two of its standards working groups — Geoscience Terminology and EarthResourceML — convened in May in Madrid in conjunction with the [34th Geoscience Information Consortium](http://www.geology.cz/gic) (GIC) conference at the Spanish Geological Survey, IGME. Progress was made towards publishing several new geoscience vocabularies. Progress was also made towards publication of a new version of EarthResourceML (version 3.0), to address some issues identified by current users of the EarthResourceML v2.0 data transfer standard.

### IUGS Deep-time Digital Earth program (DDE)
